    CALCULATION MEMORANDUM - REINFORCED CONCRETE BEAM
    
    Project: Office Building
    Regulation: NCh430:2008
    
    Input data:
    - Dead load: 25 kN/m
    - Live load: 15 kN/m
    - Span: 6.0 m
    - Concrete: H25 (f'c = 25 MPa)
    - Steel: A630-420H (fy = 420 MPa)
    
    Calculations according to NCh430:
    Total load = 25 + 15 = 40 kN/m
    Maximum moment = 40 * 6¬≤ / 8 = 180 kN¬∑m
    Required strength = 180 / 0.9 = 200 kN¬∑m
    
    Concrete strength verification:
    - Design strength: fc = 0.8 * 25 = 20 MPa (NCh430 requirement)
    - Elastic modulus: Ec = 4700 * ‚àö25 = 23500 MPa
    
    Required reinforcement:
    As = 200000000 / (0.9 * 420 * 0.85 * 0.5) = 1240 mm¬≤
    Adopted: 4œÜ20 (As = 1257 mm¬≤)
    
    Verification results:
    - Ductility: COMPLIES (NCh430 Section 5.2)
    - Cracking: COMPLIES (NCh430 Section 5.3)
    - Minimum reinforcement: COMPLIES (NCh430 Section 5.4)
